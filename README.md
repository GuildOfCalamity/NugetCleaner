## üéõÔ∏è Description
- A cleaner utility for outdated packages which can consume a large amount of space on your local storage.
	- The `Report Only` mode will scan for and display package total sizes based on the stale amount (in days).
	- Because this is meant to run as a self-contained/stand-alone utility, I suggest leaving the profile as `Unpackaged`.
	- I'll admit I went a bit overboard: making custom controls, custom dialogs, embedded asset extentions, toast notification helpers, encrypted profile setting reader/writer, window message interception, et. al. but don't forget to give a ‚≠ê if you find any of my code helpful or educational.
